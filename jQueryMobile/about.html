            <div><h2 style="color:#0075b4;">About Us</h2></div>

            <div>
                <div>Creative Alignments is a trusted partner and go-to resource to fully manage the recruiting and placement of new hires<br />and provide ongoing human resources insight and support.</div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE DELIVER SUCCESS.</h4>In 2012 alone, we successfully placed approximately 160 people in positions that span all levels, functions, and industries.  Our clients can attest to our valued partnerships.  See "<a href="clients_say.html">What Our Clients Say</a>".  </div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE CAN SAVE YOU MONEY.</h4>We do not charge contingency fees.  Through our hourly billing model, you can save up to 50% per hire vs. using contingency recruiters.  For one client in rapid growth mode, we hired 32 employees in 7 months, saving them over $450,000 (really!).  </div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE CAN SAVE YOU TIME.</h4>As we all know, hiring is time-consuming and can distract hiring managers from their core revenue-generating responsibilities. With our time & materials model, you can let us do the work while you focus on your core business and - given our expertise -enjoy the quicker time-to-hire.  </div>



                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE ARE A FULL SOLUTION.</h4>Unlike most recruiting agencies, we are well-versed in HR best practices in addition to recruiting, allowing us to tackle additional HR needs for you as well.  </div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE ARE NIMBLE.</h4>We can create a customized solution for your needs, from targeted candidate pipeline development to full-cycle recruiting to many other options in between and beyond.  We can work onsite at your offices or offsite at our HQ in Boulder.  We can also fluidly flex our time up or down in response to your changing needs.</div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE FIND HIDDEN GEMS AND ARE YOUR BRAND AMBASSADORS.</h4>We know that relying only on active applicants does not necessarily yield the best talent.  We are deeply skilled in the "art" of searching for passive talent and have invested extensively in tools that allow us to find these hidden gems.  And when we reach out to individuals, we take seriously the special role we play in representing your brand.  </div>



                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE ARE EXPERIENCED WITH ALL SHAPES AND SIZES.</h4>We work with businesses of all sizes, on projects large and small, with a special focus on Colorado's growth industries such as high tech (software/IT), creative services (marketing/design), and LOHAS (natural foods/products/services).   </div>

                <div><h4 style="color:#aa3339;margin-bottom:5px;">WE ARE A SMART, EXPERIENCED, AND COLLABORATIVE TEAM.</h4>Our highly experienced (and super fun) team fluidly shares its deep networks, resources, and expertise to find the best talent for each client.  We meet weekly as a team to brainstorm on how to creatively approach each of your open positions, leveraging our belief (and Aristotle's) that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" - although our "parts" are pretty impressive too, as most team members have 10-15 years of experience in recruiting, HR, or both.  </div>
